# CSCI401_Spring2017
Capstone collaboration project with JPL/NASA to build multi-platform VR clients with peripherals for feature-rich remote design review experience.

NOTE: Code is being hosted on GitLab since they offer free private repos. Project will be available here in the coming weeks when it is finished!
